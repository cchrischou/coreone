    Now it’s 2023. Weird. 2023 doesn’t even sound like a real number right? I think this was when I started to utilize my freedom. 
    I was traveling more. Experiencing more. For some weird reason I went to a lot of basketball games. 
    During this time I think I learned how precious and valuable home was and how privileged I am to have a home to call MY home. 
    It was exciting because everytime I went back, I had people who loved me waiting for me.

    I will say my feelings about my university at the time were still not appealing. 
    I didn’t hate it but I also knew that I had to leave. As a result, that burden I felt after I graduated my senior year still lingered. 
    I felt like I wasn’t a student, but instead,  just a placeholder until I really went to a school I loved. 
    This led me to make a hard decision. I ultimately decided to take a gap year. 
    The reason was to commit myself into making an art portfolio so that I could pursue my passions that I was too afraid to pursue due to the risks and the unknown. 
    Things just got even scarier…But guess what? When you think you’re alone when you are struggling, you’re not! 
    Before my friends left for college that summer, they surprised me at my house for my 19th birthday. 
    They became an inspiration to one of my first art pieces. I love them.

    Besides that, I visited South Korea AGAIN. I know. I’m now taking a gap year and for some reason going on a vacation. 
    Although, this time when I went it was more fun than the year before because I went with my whole family which we haven’t done since 2017. 
    I remember my Grandma and Uncle were so happy. On top of that, I got to actually meet friends that I made my freshman year of college. 
    I visited a special person too. That summer in Korea left me yearning for more after I left.
