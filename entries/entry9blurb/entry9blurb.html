    <h1 class="h1">Growing up, As Seen On TV commercials was something that I always looked forward to after school while watching TV.
        For however long, I used to rewwatch this old brownie pan commercial on YouTube due to the fascination of how perfectly
        square these brownies were. The commercial made them look so delicious with the colorful candies and the exciting
        children. I remember I used to beg my Mom to buy this pan. <br> <br>
        
        Looking back now, the aesthetic of the commercial having been so 2000s coded and the usage of vibrant blue, yellows, and reds to
        show the urgency of the "low" price was always so captivating to me. </h1>
