    HELLO 2024! GOODBYE 2023!! It’s January and at the time I was in the process of applying to schools but lets fast forward a bit. 
    I got in!!! I got into my top school, Parsons. I have finally committed and I was on break until school started in the fall. 
    During this time, I just hung around the house. 
    I had a small job teaching after school programs and I just enjoyed this free time.

    You guys won’t believe this but I did go back to South Korea in the summer. 
    I saved up my money from work and went on a solo trip. If I thought the summer in Korea the year before was great, then the summer in Korea this past year was amazing. 
    Solo trips are a great way to gain independence and to feel empowered. 
    I had so much fun eating everywhere, shopping everywhere, and even visiting the islands in Korea.
    Ugh… I wish I could go back. Unfortunately after I came back from Korea I caught covid. 
    Due to this, I couldn’t really see my friends before I went back to school which was sad but I guess it was ok since I had a new life ahead of me to look forward to.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here I am now in the fall, where I finally moved into school. I couldn’t believe it, I was in New York and I was a design student. 
    My dreams were coming true. I finally felt like myself.
