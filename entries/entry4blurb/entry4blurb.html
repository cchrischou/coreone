        It’s 2022 and we had just started to get back into the real world after covid. I started to feel like myself again. 
        I was a senior in high school and I can still remember how it felt when I was a freshman. 
        At the time it was so weird to even think about graduating. 
        I even got to speak at my graduation which was a very empowering experience.

        After graduating, I went to South Korea to visit my Grandma after many years. 
        I remember feeling very nervous because in the back of my mind I knew that when I came back to the U.S. I had to go to college. 
        The truth is I didn’t even want to go to the university I committed to. 
        I wasn’t relieved when I graduated because my passion was in design but I settled for a major that wasn’t very strong in design as well as a university that wasn’t strong in art. 
        What was I doing?? I couldn’t tell you. Anyway, during this trip in Korea I still had to prepare myself to go to college. 
        Korea was still fun. I spent so much time with my Mom, Grandma, and Uncle.

        Eventually I came home from Korea and spent time with friends and family. 
        I still remember how bittersweet it was. For my 18th birthday my friends came over and I remember almost crying at their surprise cake. 
        Afterwards, I moved into school. It was better than I expected. I met some great people and a special person. 
        Coming home for breaks like a real college student was also weird because I remember when my older sisters used to come home during their breaks and how I always viewed that as an “old” person thing. 
        This was truly when I started to feel like I was also getting older.
